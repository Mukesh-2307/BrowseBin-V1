#Bookmark Manager App (BrowseBin)

objective: To build an app that help user to add, organize and access their web bookmarks efficiently.

organizing = structuring and categorizing saved bookmarks.

user functions:
1. Add bookmarks (create)
2. Browse bookmarks (read)
3. Edit bookmarks (update)
4. Remove bookmarks (delete)

additional functions:
1. Search a bookmark
2. Removing duplicates
3. Cleaning up old or broken links
4. Favorite bookmarks
5. Open link in a new tab

user inputs:
1. Link of the site that he/she want to add
2. Name (to make the bookmark easy to remember)
3. Category (to add a filter capablity).
    a. There will be few fixed categories so that it is easier to maintain (for me).

How will I:
1. add bookmark:
    take input from user
    create an object containing all the info
    add to a master array
    save to local storage

2. browse bookmarks:
    . bookmarks will be visible in the form of card
    . the main page will display all overview card.
    . overview card will contain name and go to link btn.
    . on clicking the overview card, the main card will be visible
    . main card will contain name, url (now full url will be visible), edit and delete btn.

    . filter by A-Z / createdOn / old-new / new-old /
